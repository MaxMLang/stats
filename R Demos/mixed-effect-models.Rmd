# Introduction: What are Hierarchical Models?

Hierarchical models, also known as multilevel models or mixed-effects models, are statistical models that account for data with a nested or grouped structure. In our example, mosquito abundance measurements are nested within villages.

## Alternative Modeling Approaches

Before diving into hierarchical models, let's consider two extreme approaches to handling grouped data:

### 1. Complete Pooling: Ignoring the Grouping Structure

In this approach, we completely ignore that observations come from different villages and fit a single model:

$$y_{ij} = \beta_0 + \varepsilon_{ij}$$

Where:
- $y_{ij}$ is the $j$-th observation in village $i$
- $\beta_0$ represents a constant overall intercept
- $\varepsilon_{ij} \sim N(0, \sigma^2)$ is the error term

The least squares estimator is simply:
$$\hat{\beta}_0 = \bar{y} = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{n_{villages}}\sum_{j=1}^{n_i} y_{ij}$$

**Problems with complete pooling:**
- Treats all observations as coming from a single homogeneous population
- Ignores village-level variation
- Underestimates uncertainty for village-specific predictions
- Can lead to incorrect inferences about treatment effects

### 2. No Pooling: Complete Differentiation of Groups

At the other extreme, we could fit a separate model for each village:

$$y_{ij} = \eta_i + \varepsilon_{ij}$$

Where:
- $\eta_i$ represents the village-specific effect (treated as fixed)
- Each village gets its own parameter

The least squares estimator for each village is:
$$\hat{\eta}_i = \bar{y}_i = \frac{1}{n_i}\sum_{j=1}^{n_i} y_{ij}$$

**Problems with no pooling:**
- Doesn't borrow strength across villages
- Can overfit, especially with small sample sizes per village
- Treats villages as completely unrelated
- Cannot make inferences about new villages

### 3. Partial Pooling: The Hierarchical Model Solution

Hierarchical models provide a middle ground through **partial pooling**:

$$y_{ij} = \mu_0 + u_i + \varepsilon_{ij}$$

Where:
- $u_i \sim N(0, \sigma^2_{village})$ is the random village effect
- Villages are related through a common distribution

This approach:
- Borrows strength across villages
- Shrinks extreme estimates toward the grand mean
- Provides a natural way to handle unbalanced data
- Allows inference about the population of villages


## The Mathematical Framework of Hierarchical Models

## The Mathematical Framework

A two-level hierarchical model can be written as:

**Level 1 (Observation level):**
$$Y_{ij} | \mu_i \sim N(\mu_i, \sigma^2_{within})$$

Where:
- $Y_{ij}$ is the $j$-th observation in village $i$
- $\mu_i$ is the true mean for village $i$
- $\sigma^2_{within}$ is the within-village variance

**Level 2 (Village level):**
$$\mu_i \sim N(\mu_0, \sigma^2_{village})$$

Where:
- $\mu_0$ is the grand mean (population mean across all villages)
- $\sigma^2_{village}$ is the between-village variance

## Combined Model

We can also write this as a single equation:
$$Y_{ij} = \mu_0 + u_i + \epsilon_{ij}$$

Where:
- $u_i \sim N(0, \sigma^2_{village})$ is the random village effect
- $\epsilon_{ij} \sim N(0, \sigma^2_{within})$ is the within-village error
- $u_i$ and $\epsilon_{ij}$ are independent

## Variance Decomposition

The total variance in the data is:
$$Var(Y_{ij}) = \sigma^2_{village} + \sigma^2_{within}$$

The **Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC)** measures the proportion of variance due to villages:
$$ICC = \frac{\sigma^2_{village}}{\sigma^2_{village} + \sigma^2_{within}}$$



# Visualizing the Hierarchical Structure

## Basic Visualization

```{r}
# Step 7: Create the basic plot first
p_basic <- ggplot(data_strong_extended, aes(x = village, y = abundance)) +
  # Village boxplots
  geom_boxplot(aes(fill = village), alpha = 0.7, width = 0.6) +
  # Individual observations
  geom_jitter(width = 0.15, alpha = 0.3, size = 0.8) +
  # True village means
  geom_point(data = village_stats, 
             aes(y = true_mean), 
             color = "red", 
             size = 3, 
             shape = 18) +
  # Grand mean line
  geom_hline(yintercept = grand_mean, 
             linetype = "dashed", 
             color = "darkred", 
             linewidth = 1) +
  scale_x_discrete(labels = function(x) gsub("V", "", x)) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "none",
        axis.text.x = element_text(size = 8)) +
  labs(title = "Strong Village Effects: Villages as Random Draws from Normal Distribution",
       subtitle = sprintf("Grand mean = %.0f (dashed line) | Village SD = %.0f | Within-village SD = %.0f", 
                         grand_mean, village_sd, 2),
       x = "Village",
       y = "Mosquito Abundance",
       caption = "Red diamonds = true village means")

print(p_basic)
```

### What This Plot Shows:

1. **Between-village variation**: Notice how the red diamonds (true village means) vary substantially around the grand mean (dashed line). This variation follows $N(\mu_0, \sigma^2_{village}) = N(20, 10^2)$.

2. **Within-village variation**: Each boxplot shows the distribution within a village. The spread within each box is much smaller than the spread between village means, reflecting $\sigma_{within} = 2 << \sigma_{village} = 10$.

3. **Hierarchical structure**: Each observation belongs to two distributions:
   - First, its village mean is drawn from $N(20, 10^2)$
   - Then, the observation is drawn from $N(\mu_i, 2^2)$

       caption = "Blue triangles = village means from N(20,10²) | Boxes = observations from N(village_mean, 2²)")

print(p_hierarchical)
```

### Mathematical Interpretation:

The blue shaded regions represent probability zones for village means:
- **Dark blue (±1σ)**: Contains ~68% of village means, i.e., $P(\mu_0 - \sigma_{village} < \mu_i < \mu_0 + \sigma_{village}) \approx 0.68$
- **Light blue (±2σ)**: Contains ~95% of village means, i.e., $P(\mu_0 - 2\sigma_{village} < \mu_i < \mu_0 + 2\sigma_{village}) \approx 0.95$

### Understanding the Two-Level Structure:

The green distributions show the **conditional distribution** of observations given the village:
$$Y_{ij} | \mu_i \sim N(\mu_i, 2^2)$$

Each green curve is centered at its village's true mean (blue triangle), which itself was drawn from:
$$\mu_i \sim N(20, 10^2)$$

# Model Fitting and Assumption Verification

## Fitting the Random Effects Model

When we fit a random effects model using `lmer`, we're estimating:

$$Y_{ij} = \beta_0 + u_i + \epsilon_{ij}$$

Where:
- $\beta_0$ estimates $\mu_0$ (fixed effect)
- $u_i \sim N(0, \sigma^2_{village})$ (random effect)
- $\epsilon_{ij} \sim N(0, \sigma^2_{within})$ (residual)

The model estimates:
- $\hat{\beta}_0$ (estimated grand mean)
- $\hat{\sigma}^2_{village}$ (estimated between-village variance)
- $\hat{\sigma}^2_{within}$ (estimated within-village variance)

### Interpreting Level 2 Diagnostics:

**Q-Q Plot Interpretation:**
- Points on the line → Normal distribution confirmed
- S-shaped curve → Heavy or light tails
- Systematic deviation → Non-normality

**What if Level 2 assumption fails?**
- Consider transformation of response variable
- Use robust methods (e.g., t-distribution for random effects)
- Check for outlier villages

# Independence Assumptions

## Mathematical Framework for Independence

Independence in hierarchical models has three components:

1. **Between-village independence**: $Cov(u_i, u_j) = 0$ for $i \neq j$
2. **Within-village conditional independence**: $Cov(\epsilon_{ij}, \epsilon_{ik} | u_i) = 0$ for $j \neq k$
3. **Cross-level independence**: $Cov(u_i, \epsilon_{jk}) = 0$ for all $i, j, k$

## Moran's I Test for Spatial Autocorrelation

Moran's I statistic tests for spatial autocorrelation:

$$I = \frac{n}{\sum_{i}\sum_{j}w_{ij}} \frac{\sum_{i}\sum_{j}w_{ij}(y_i - \bar{y})(y_j - \bar{y})}{\sum_{i}(y_i - \bar{y})^2}$$

Where:
- $w_{ij}$ is the spatial weight between villages $i$ and $j$
- $y_i$ is the residual for village $i$
- $\bar{y}$ is the mean residual

```{r}
# Calculate Moran's I
# Create spatial weights matrix (inverse distance)
W <- 1/dist_matrix
diag(W) <- 0
W <- W/rowSums(W)  # Row-standardize

# Calculate Moran's I manually
n <- nrow(village_summary)
y <- village_summary$mean_residual
y_mean <- mean(y)
y_centered <- y - y_mean

# Numerator
numerator <- sum(W * outer(y_centered, y_centered))
# Denominator  
denominator <- sum(y_centered^2)
# Moran's I
morans_i <- (n / sum(W)) * (numerator / denominator)

cat(sprintf("\nMoran's I statistic: %.4f\n", morans_i))
cat("Expected value under null hypothesis (no spatial correlation): ")
cat(sprintf("E[I] = -1/(n-1) = %.4f\n", -1/(n-1)))
cat("Values near 0 indicate no spatial autocorrelation\n")
cat("Positive values indicate positive spatial autocorrelation\n")
cat("Negative values indicate negative spatial autocorrelation\n")

## Temporal Independence and ACF

The autocorrelation function (ACF) at lag $k$ is:

$$\rho_k = \frac{\sum_{t=1}^{n-k}(y_t - \bar{y})(y_{t+k} - \bar{y})}{\sum_{t=1}^{n}(y_t - \bar{y})^2}$$

Under independence, $\rho_k \approx 0$ for all $k > 0$.

```{r}
# 3G. ACF plot for overall temporal correlation
acf_data <- acf(data_with_location$residuals, plot = FALSE)
acf_df <- data.frame(
  lag = acf_data$lag[-1],  # Remove lag 0
  acf = acf_data$acf[-1]
)

# Calculate confidence bounds

# Summary: The Complete Hierarchical Model

## Final Mathematical Representation

Our complete hierarchical model is:

**Distributional form:**
- Level 1: $Y_{ij} | \mu_i \sim N(\mu_i, \sigma^2_{within})$
- Level 2: $\mu_i \sim N(\mu_0, \sigma^2_{village})$

**Mixed effects form:**
$$Y_{ij} = \mu_0 + u_i + \epsilon_{ij}$$

Where:
- $u_i \sim N(0, \sigma^2_{village})$ independent across villages
- $\epsilon_{ij} \sim N(0, \sigma^2_{within})$ independent across observations
- $u_i \perp \epsilon_{ij}$ (random effects independent of residuals)

## Key Parameters and Interpretations

1. **Fixed effect**: $\mu_0$ = overall population mean
2. **Random effect variance**: $\sigma^2_{village}$ = between-village variability
3. **Residual variance**: $\sigma^2_{within}$ = within-village variability
4. **ICC**: $\rho = \frac{\sigma^2_{village}}{\sigma^2_{village} + \sigma^2_{within}}$ = correlation between observations in same village

## Why Use Hierarchical Models?

1. **Correct standard errors**: Accounts for clustering
2. **Partial pooling**: Borrows strength across villages
3. **Variance decomposition**: Quantifies variation at each level
4. **Generalizability**: Inferences about population of villages
5. **Flexibility**: Can add predictors at multiple levels

This framework extends naturally to more complex scenarios with additional levels, predictors, and random slopes.
