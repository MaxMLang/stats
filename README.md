# Welcome to My Stats Notes! 📈

Hi there! I'm Max, and you've stumbled upon my personal stash of statistics notes and learning materials. This repo is like my digital notebook, filled with all sorts of insights and tidbits on statistics that I've gathered on my learning journey.

## What's Inside? 🗂

Inside, you'll find a bunch of LaTeX files that cover a wide range of stats topics. From the very basics to more head-scratching concepts, it's all laid out in files that I've tried to keep as neat and reader-friendly as possible. 

Whether you're trying to understand probability, get your head around hypothesis testing, or dive into the deep end with Bayesian stats, there's something here for you. And the best part? You can easily import everything into Overleaf if that's your thing, making it super easy to read or even add your own notes.

## How This Works 🛠

### Getting Your Hands on the Notes

To grab a copy of my notes, all you need to do is clone this repo:

`git clone https://github.com/MaxMLang/stats.git`


### Viewing and Editing

I've set up everything in LaTeX, so if you're into that, you can pop the files into Overleaf for a better viewing experience. Or, if you're feeling adventurous, tweak them to your heart's content.

## Wanna Chip In? 🤝

Look, I'm just a person trying to make sense of statistics, and this repo is my way of organizing what I learn. If you've got some knowledge to share, spotted an error, or have suggestions for improvement, I'd be thrilled to hear from you. 

Contributing is easy:
1. Fork the repo.
2. Create your branch (`git checkout -b my-awesome-contribution`).
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Making stats even cooler'`).
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin my-awesome-contribution`).
5. Open a pull request.

Let's make learning stats a little less daunting together!


## Cheers to Our Stats Journey! 🎉

Thanks for stopping by. Dive in, explore, and let's tackle the wild world of statistics!
